At Cookpad we build a global product to not only make cooking fun every day but also *everywhere*.
With the help of the Rails Internationalization (i18n) API we have brought Cookpad to over 30 languages around the world.

However, translating a product in 30 languages is not easy, and we're constantly learning and improving.

In the following we will introduce one approach we've adopted for handling formatting of translated phrases.

# Our Workflow
- Working on a new feature, our development team uploads all new phrases in English to [OneSky](https://www.oneskyapp.com/).
- Our colleagues around the world use the OneSky UI to translate new phrases.
- Once a day an automated background job imports any new translations back into our repository.

# Passing Variables to Translations
As stated in the [Rails i18n guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#passing-variables-to-translations), a key consideration for successfully internationalizing an application is to avoid making incorrect assumptions about grammar rules when abstracting localized code.

Let's have a look at the following example:
```erb
<%= "#{t('currency')}#{@product.price}" %>
```

```yaml
en:
  currency: "$"
de:
  currency: "€"
```

This translation makes the assumption that currency is always shown in front of the price.

However, a correct translation for German would be `10 €` instead of `€10`.

A better abstraction would be:

```erb
<%= t("product_price", price: @product.price) %>
```

```yaml
en:
  product_price: "$%{price}"
de:
  product_price: "%{price} €"
```

# Adding Formatting

So far so good!
But what happens if we now need to make the currency bold?

Luckily you can use [HTML in translations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#using-safe-html-translations) by adding a `_html` suffix to the key.

We can now simply add a `<b>` tag in our translation:

```erb
<%= t("product_price_html", price: @product.price) %>
```

```yaml
en:
  product_price_html: "<b>$</b>%{price}"
de:
  product_price_html: "%{price} <b>€</b>"
```

Problem solved, right?

Not quite, because we're now _mixing content and formatting_ which leads to other problems:

- Our translators are not developers, and may get confused by or make
  mistakes when editing the translation.
- If we want to change the formatting, we now have to change _all the
  translations_
- If the markup is even _slightly_ more involved than a simple `<b>` (ie
  links, HTML classes etc), it quickly becomes a maintenance nightmare, that's also very prone mistakes.

# Solution
The solution we've adopted is to _pass in any formatting to the translation_:

```erb
<%= t "product_price_html",
  price: @product.price,
  currency: tag.b(t("currency"))
%>
```

```yaml
en:
  currency: $
  product_price_html: "%{currency}%{price}"
de:
  currency: €
  product_price_html: "%{price} %{currency}"
```

This can scale to accomodate even complicated markup, by combining
strings:


```erb
<%= t "have_account_html",
  link: link_to(t("login"), logout_path, class: "link-primary")
%>
```

```yaml
en:
  have_account_html: "Already have an account? %{link}"
  login: "Login here."
```

# Summary

While it may take a bit of extra work and the erb markup grow slightly more than we'd ideally wish for,
ultimately we think it's worth it for the problems it saves us from in the long run.

Your translators (and future you) will thank you!
